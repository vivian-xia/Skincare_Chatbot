Refinery29,"Repeat after me: Happy skin is hydrated skin. I cannot stress this enough. So many of our skin concerns could be minimised if we maximised our hydration, especially as we age. You want to look for ingredients that keep your skin looking and feeling hydrated while helping to protect your skin barrier, 'cause when that barrier breaks your problems start. We'd recommend thirst-quenching ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane as well as resurfacing ingredients like AHA/BHA's.
Try:
Hyaluronic acid: First let's talk about hyaluronic acid, easily the most buzz-worthy ingredient to come out of skincare in the last decade. It's good for myriad reasons, and for thirsty skin, it's a must. Naturally, our bodies do produce a certain amount of hyaluronic acid, however, it lasts less than one day in the skin so we are parched, people, and that's where the topical products come in. When applied topically, hyaluronic acid helps to deliver a much-needed boost of moisture, locks in hydration and plumps our skin. It should be applied before all your other active ingredients so that it can be fully absorbed into your skin.
Squalane: Squalane is a relatively 'new' skincare ingredient that's drawing a lot of well-earned hype. It's full of natural moisturising factors that closely mimic our skin's natural oils, so it delivers a very effortless and easily absorbed dose of hydration. It locks moisture into the skin without leaving a greasy residue or feeling heavy and is suitable for all skin types.
AHA/BHA: Tired, dehydrated skin often needs a little more TLC, and using an AHA (alpha-hydroxy acids — glycolic and lactic) or BHA (salicylic acid) based product in your lineup will do just that. AHA products work to get rid of any dead skin cells, dirt, and oil build-up that might be stopping your active ingredients from getting deep into the skin and working their magic, while your BHAs can help boost hydration and even out skin tone.
If You've Got Acne-Prone Skin
Breakouts and congested skin can be super frustrating to treat, especially as an adult, but once you can identify the cause of your spots, the right ingredients and products can clear it right up and help prevent future breakouts. You'll want to look for products that contain exfoliating acids like AHA/BHAs, hydrators like squalane and hyaluronic acid and if your skin's ready for it, retinol.
Try:
AHA/BHAs: When it comes to treating congested or acne-prone skin, an AHA or BHA product should be one of your first go-to's. AHA/BHAs help promote cellular turnover and breaking down congestion on the surface of the skin that causes blocked pores, blackheads and pimples. Your AHA-based products contain acids like glycolic and lactic acid that help visibly improve skin tone and texture, as well as reducing the appearance of dark spots. While your BHA products reduce the appearance of blemishes and unclogs pores.
Hydrators: Our two heroes, squalane and hyaluronic acid. It's commonly assumed that if you have oily, acne-prone skin that you should back off heavily hydrating products like serums, oils and gels. However, hydration is your friend when it comes to avoiding those pesky breakouts. Look for lightweight hydrators that are non-comedogenic (pore blocking) and contain ingredients like squalane or hyaluronic acid. Both ingredients are oil balancing and work to lock moisture into the skin meaning they protect it from drying out, becoming damaged and forming breakouts.
Retinol: When it comes to treating congestion and breakouts, retinol can be what I like to call a skincare one-two punch. Not only will it help to improve skin texture, but it's also great for preventing acne. However, retinol doesn't like to necessarily play well with some of our other favourite skincare ingredients (glycolic and salicylic acids) so to avoid any irritations you should use them on alternate days/nights to be on the safe side.

If You've Got Sun Damaged Skin or Pigmentation
Ahh sun damage, also known as hyperpigmentation or sunspots, while easy to prevent (wear SPF every day!) can be super difficult to treat. We recommend wearing sunscreen (not just relying on the SPF in your base products) rain, hail and especially shine, as it helps new pigmentation from forming and old pigmentation from getting worse. And when you're not in the sun, look to work in some brightening ingredients like vitamin C, AHA and BHA into your routine. It's also important to note that some hyperpigmentation, mainly around the chin, cheeks and upper lip, can be hormonal (often comes with pregnancy) and can be a little trickier to treat. We'd recommend seeing a dermatologist to talk through treatment if that's the case.
Try:
Vitamin C: When it comes to evening out skin tone (read: minimising dark spots and discolouration), vitamin C should be your go-to. It not only helps to treat the appearance of existing hyperpigmentation but doubles as another preventative measure as well.
AHA/BHAs: By now you're probably catching on just how good these little acid combos are for your skin. AHA/BHAs help to remove dead skin cells, oil, and dirt build-up to reveal more even-looking skin. Working these into your skincare routine via a nighttime serum (not to be layered with a retinol) long-term can help reverse pigmentation caused by sun damage.
Retinol: If you really suffer from pigmentation, retinol is going to be your go-to as it has the ability to penetrate deeply enough that it actually helps to interfere with pigment production, treating those deeper, more stubborn areas of hyperpigmentation. It also boosts collagen production, speeding up skin cell turnover so topically it helps to reduce discolouration too.
And SPF, just wear it OK!
If You've Got Fine Lines and Wrinkles
When it comes to minimising the signs of ageing, (read: fine lines and wrinkles) there are a few skincare ingredients you can arm yourself with, and by now these anti-ageing bad boys need no introduction, but I'm going to anyway — AHA/BHAs, vitamin C and retinol.
Try:
AHA/BHAs: You've probably seen these acronyms on plenty of exfoliants, gels and creams in more recent years as they've fast become buzzworthy ingredients in the battle against ageing. If it's coming in the form of creams and serums, it's likely to help stimulate collagen production and promote surface hydration while reinforcing the skin's natural barrier. If it's in an exfoliant, it's looking to assist with cellular turnover — which, along with collagen production, can be among the first things to slow down as we age.
Vitamin C: Before reaching for a retinol, we'd suggest working a vitamin C based product into your routine. Vitamin C is perfect for protecting your skin from free radicals like UV rays, pollution, and other environmental aggressors while helping to boost the skin's natural collagen production abilities. And as previously mentioned, it also works as a great preventative for hyperpigmentation.
Retinol: Retinol is a tricky one to start working into your routine as there is much debate among derms as to the right age to start using it. They say it's best to start using it in your '30s, which is generally when the skin starts to age. Retinol is clinically proven to speed up cellular turnover while slowing down the breakdown of collagen in the skin, which is one of the main causes of fine lines and wrinkles. It can also improve the appearance of sun damage as it helps to even out the skin's overall look and texture.
If You've Got Dull, Uneven Skin
Most of us immediately associate bright, healthy, glowing skin with youth, hence why we're all chasing it. To avoid dull, uneven skin, you can't really go past (you probably guessed it) AHA/BHAs and vitamin C.
And if you don't know why these ingredients are good by now I'm 100 percent getting fired.
Try:
AHA/BHA: AHA and BHA (or a combination of both) is bomb for skin cell turnover and evening out the skin's texture. They prep your skin so all your delicious active ingredients like the ones mentioned above can sink into the deepest layers of your skin and do their thang.
Vitamin C: Quick recap on all the benefits of Vitamin C as mentioned above: It's an excellent brightening ingredient and protector from free radicals while helping to minimise hyperpigmentation (the main cause of dull, uneven skin).",https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-skincare-ingredients-for-every-skin-concern
Good Housekeeping,"If you struggle with persistent acne or have oily skin, these clarifying ingredients are for you. They help to mattify shine, degunk pores and slough away dead skin and bacteria for a clearer, brighter complexion that's free of whiteheads, blackheads and the rest. Start slow with these powerful ingredients and avoid using in tandem off the bat. Azelaic Acid
What it does: Produced by a naturally occurring yeast on skin, this exfoliating ingredient reduces hyperpigmentation, fades dark spots, and kills acne- and rosacea-causing bacteria.

Who it's for: All skin types, but particularly acne-prone skin.

How to use it: Twice a day (morning and night) or once every other day for sensitive skin.

FYI: Start slow — azelaic acid may cause drying or peeling on application sites. Beta-Hydroxy Acids (BHAs)
What it does: BHAs are oil-soluble acids that plunge deep into pores to target oil glands and decrease oil secretion

Who it's for: Acne-prone and oily skin, since it decreases oil secretion and nixes dead skin to prevent pimples.

How to use it: Begin with twice-weekly use at a low concentration, and increase potency and frequency as tolerated.

FYI: While it's a star on oily skin, it may cause flaking at first, particularly on dry or sensitive skin. Polyhydroxy Acid
What it does: A gentle chemical exfoliant, polyhydroxy acid (PHA) sloughs dead skin cells away from the surface for a smoother and more even texture. Salicylic Acid
What it does: A BHA best known for its exfoliating, pore-cleaning, and bacteria-fighting powers. 

Who it's for: People with oily and acne-prone skin, particularly those who want to treat and prevent whiteheads and blackheads.

How to use it: Apply as a spot treatment or swap in a salicylic acid-laced face cleanser once or twice per week, increasing frequency as tolerated.

FYI: This acne-fighting powerhouse may irritate sensitive skin or parch dry skin.

Who it’s for: Milder, less irritating and more hydrating than exfoliant cousins AHA and BHA, PHA doesn’t penetrate skin as deeply but still exfoliates which makes it perfect for sensitive skin, rosacea or eczema.

How to use it: PHA plays nicely with other active ingredients like vitamin C or retinol — start slow at first to prevent irritation. Most people can use PHAs three to four times a week without issue. One exception: Use once weekly if you use other acids like AHAs or BHAs.

FYI: The most common PHAs are gluconolactone, galactose and lactobionic acid. These heavy-hitting ingredients smooth out wrinkles and fine lines by ramping up collagen production and cellular turnover for youthful, bright-looking, even-toned skin. Since skin will be freshly exfoliated, it may feel irritated at first: Start slow, avoid using alongside other exfoliants and always follow up with SPF! Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs)
What it does: AHAs are water-soluble acids derived from fruits or sugar cane that exfoliate dull, dry skin and stimulate collagen production to lessen wrinkles.

Who it's for: Anyone whose main concern is anti-aging, or those with dry skin.

How to use it: Start with a lower concentration and work up to daily use, as tolerated.

FYI: AHAs increase skin’s sensitivity to UV rays, so use SPF every day. AHAs also may cause superficial chemical burns on darker skin tones.
Bakuchiol
What it does: This ancient botanical seed is a gentler, effective alternative to retinol. It's anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and increases collagen production, and reduces the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.

Who it's for: Safe for all skin types and those concerned with anti-aging, but particularly great for skin types that cannot tolerate retinol (e.g. sensitive skin, rosacea).

How to use it: Safe for use once to twice daily, morning or night.

FYI: Any new ingredient can cause a reaction. Start slowly and work your way up to daily use.
Glycolic Acid
What it does: An AHA that minimizes pores, fights acne, and speeds up cell turnover for fresher, clearer, younger-looking skin.

Who it's for: All skin types, though sensitive or dry skin types should use formulas with 5% concentration, max.

How to use it: Apply daily to oily and acne-prone skin at concentrations up to 10% in serums, toners, peels, and cleansers.

FYI: May cause irritation on dry or sensitive skin, or superficial burns at concentrations over 10%.

Peptides
What they do: Made of amino acids, peptides stimulate skin to make more collagen to decrease fine lines and wrinkles.
Who they’re for: Anyone looking to increase skin firmness, smooth out fine lines or wrinkles and quell inflammation.
How to use them: Peptides work well with other skincare ingredients, making them easy to incorporate into your existing skincare routine once to twice daily. Opt for products that stay on the skin for an extended period, like a moisturizer or serum.
FYI: Look for ingredients that end with ""peptide"" or begin with ""palmitoyl"" on the ingredient label.
Retinol
What it does: A fat-soluble derivative of vitamin A, retinol is the reliable OTC anti-aging ingredient. It prevents collagen degeneration, encourages skin cell turnover, and strengthens skin against wrinkle formation.
Who it's for: Safe for all skin types, but best for mature skin types or anyone who wants to prevent signs of aging.
How to use it: Use once daily before bed, alternating nights of application and increasing frequency to nightly, once skin adjusts.
FYI: Retinol can be irritating and cause redness, dryness, peeling at first: Don't use alongside any chemical exfoliants or acids. Since it increases sun sensitivity, use SPF every day.

Vitamin C
What it does: This potent antioxidan helps brighten skin and fade hyperpigmentation by blocking melanin production, fights free radical damage from environmental stressors and boosts collagen production, reducing signs of aging.
Who it’s for: Any skin type, especially skin that’s hyperpigmented, dull or UV-damaged.
How to use it: Apply in a leave-on treatment like a serum or cream in the a.m., before SPF. Start slowly once a day at a lower concentration and increase to twice a day as tolerated. To avoid irritation, steer clear of pairing vitamin C with retinol or exfoliating ingredients like AHAs.
FYI: Look for an opaque or dark-colored, airtight container and ingredients like vitamin E and ferulic acid to improve stability and efficacy. Too much vitamin C can irritate skin; stick to a potency of 10% to 20%.
Vitamin E
What it does: Both an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory, vitamin E prevents skin discoloration, protects against damage and signs of aging caused by free radicals and staves off acne breakouts.
Who it’s for: Products formulated with vitamin E work well for most skin types, but it’s particularly helpful for acne-prone, discolored or aging skin.
How to use it: Drier skin types can apply pure vitamin E oil directly to the skin once to twice daily. Combination and oily skin types may want to opt for a product that's formulated with the ingredient.
FYI: Vitamin E pops up as “tocopherol” on some ingredient labels. If you have oily skin, don’t use straight vitamin E oil on its own as it might exacerbate clogged pores.
If your skin is dry, sensitive, prone to redness, or plagued by eczema, these calming, nourishing hydrators will be your saviors. Use them alone and/or immediately following any exfoliation regimen (above!).

Ceramides
What it does: This type of naturally-occurring fat holds skin cells together to help form a waterproof seal and healthy skin barrier that keeps skin hydrated.
Who it's for: Everyone, but particularly those with mature skin and eczema-prone, irritated, or dry, itchy skin.
How to use it: Apply daily in a lotion or cream alone or following retinoids, hydroxyacids, and exfoliants to stave off potential irritation.
FYI: Ceramides are naturally-occurring, but deplete with age and poor skin health. Luckily, OTC ceramides are bio-identical to what skin naturally produces.
Cica
What it does: Centella asiatica (a.k.a. cica) is an herb rich in anti-inflammatories that calms redness and irritation, regulates collagen synthesis, and protects against environmental damage.
Who it's for: Everyone, but particularly those who struggle with acne, rosacea, or severe dryness and sensitivity.
How to use it: Apply a cica-packed cream or serum to clean skin nightly, when skin is in repair mode.
FYI: Check the ingredients list — cica, tiger grass, centella asiatica, or madecassoside should be near the top.
Humectants
What it does: Humectants are water-loving ingredients that draw moisture into skin to help increase moisture content over time.
Who it's for: Any skin type (even oily skin requires some hydration!), but especially essential for dry skin.
How to use it: Humectants like glycerin, hylauronic acid, aloe, and urea are most often formulated in moisturizers and creams alongside occlusives and emollients. Apply once to twice daily.
FYI: Since humecants draw moisture from anywhere, they might increase skin dryness if you live in a very dry environment by absorbing water from the skin instead of the air.

Hyaluronic Acid (HA)
What it does: A naturally-produced sugar molecule found in our skin, joints, and connective tissue, this gentle humectant attracts up to 1,000 times its weight in water to hydrate, smooth, and plump dry or wrinkled skin.
Who it's for: All skin types (allergic reactions are rare since it's naturally occurring), but particularly helpful for dry or mature skin in need of deep hydration.
How to use it: Most often found in products that are left on the skin (e.g. creams, lotions, serums, masks), HA can be used twice daily even on sensitive skin.
FYI: Skin produces less natural HA with age, which contributes to sallowness and wrinkles. Check skincare labels for mention of ""sodium hyaluronate.""
Niacinamide
What it does: This water-soluble derivative of niacin or vitamin B3 (an essential vitamin not produced by the body) is lauded its anti-inflammatory, soothing, brightening, and skin tone-evening benefits.
Who it's for: All skin types; it can help reduce sebum production on oily skin, retain moisture on dry skin, and foster ceramide production to repair skin compromised by rosacea or eczema.
How to use it: It's typically formulated into leave-on products like serums and creams and best used twice per day.
Caution: The way niacinamide works in the skin is not fully understood, but several studies have shown clinical skincare benefits.
Occlusives
What it does: These moisturizing agents form a protective layer on skin’s surface to prevent moisture loss and shield skin from external irritants like friction, cold, wind and pollen.
Who it’s for: Thick and heavy, occlusives are best for people for dry, dehydrated, sensitive or reactive skin.
How to use it: Alongside humectants, occlusives are present in most hydrating skincare products, from lip balm to moisturizer. They’re safe to use on dry skin multiple times daily.
FYI: Petrolatum, silicones, shea butter and beeswax are all occlusives. Occlusives are likely too rich for those with oily skin and since they contain mainly oil-based ingredients, they may leave skin with a sheen.
Polyglutamic Acid
What it does: A natural polymer and humectant, polyglutamic acid (PGA) is a super hydrator that attracts up to 5,000 times its weight in water to hydrate skin and make it look and feel more plump with reduced fine lines and wrinkles.
Who it’s for: PGA is gentle and hydrating so it's universally beneficial for a hydration boost as needed on all skin types and all environments for a dewy look.
How to use it: It can be added into any skincare routine and doesn’t interfere with products like vitamin C, retinol or niacinimide. Those with dry skin can use it multiple times daily, while those with oilier skin types (or who live in a humid climate) may want to apply more sparingly.
FYI: For best results, look for polyglutamic acid in the top half of ingredients on products that are left on skin rather than rinsed off.
Face oils are the cherry on top of any skincare regimen, and there's one out there for every type of skin. Use them solo, mix them into a moisturizer, or press them onto skin as the last step of your nighttime routine for glowing, nourished skin.
Castor Oil
What it does: Pressed from seeds of the plant ricinus communis, castor oil is loaded with emollient fatty acids that hydrate and make flaky skin feel softer, as well as ricinoleic acid, a potent antioxidant that protects the skin from free radicals that cause collagen loss and wrinkles.
Who it's for: All skin types, but particularly beneficial for dry or mature skin. Castor oil is also great for thinning or sparse eyebrows and eyelashes by helping to condition and thicken hairs.
How to use it: Apply to clean, dry skin one to two times per day as needed. Apply sparingly on brows or lashes, taking care to avoid contact with eyes.
FYI: Castor oil is commonly diluted in a carrier oil for skincare. Applying straight castor oil may lead to skin irritation, inflammation, and dryness.
Jojoba Oil
What it does: Produced from the seeds of the simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) plant, jojoba oil is a lightweight yet hydrating oil to soften and hydrate skin, diminish the appearance of wrinkles, and reduce inflammation.
Who it's for: Jojoba mimics our skin’s natural oils, so it's well-tolerated by all skin types. Its composition is similar to skin's natural sebum, so it won't clog pores yet is deeply hydrating.
How to use it: For dry skin, press jojoba oil into skin up to twice per day right after cleansing. If you have oily skin, try using it every other day or mixed in with a moisturizer.
FYI: Though rare, it does have the potential to cause some side effects such as a rash or allergic reaction.
Rosehip Oil
What it does: Harvested from the seeds of rose bushes, rosehip oil is packed with anti-inflammatory fatty acids and vitamins A and C which smooth, firm, and brighten skin and fade scars, hyperpigmentation, and stretch marks.
Who it's for: Well-tolerated by most skin types, but great for anyone looking to fade scars, boost glow, and firm skin.
How to use it: Start small by patting a few drops on cleansed skin at bedtime. Work up to rubbing on to clean, damp skin both mornings and evenings.
FYI: Allergies to rosehip oil are rare, but any new ingredient can potentially trigger a reaction. Apply a test patch to your jawline first and let sit 24 hours.
Squalane Oil
What it does: The hydrogenated, shelf-stable version of squalene (a lipid naturally produced by our oil glands) closely mimics the natural molecule to hydrate, repair, and protect the skin's barrier.
Who it's for: All types of skin, but particularly for soothing dry skin and eczema, but it's also oily skin-friendly since it's lightweight, non-greasy, and unlikely to clog pores.
How to use it: Twice a day, after cleansing and applying serum, apply a few drops of squalane oil to the face and follow with moisturizer.
FYI: Traditionally, squalene is sourced from sharks' livers, though many brands have shifted to plant-based sources like rice bran, wheat germ, and sugar cane.

Vogue,"AHAs
Hartman explains that alpha-hydroxy-acids, or AHAs for short, “encourage exfoliation and have anti-aging properties,” making them “staples in acne medications” or a thoughtful adjunct to his trio of necessities. This category of exfoliators includes lactic, glycolic, and mandelic acids, but he cautions to introduce them slowly into your routine to boost exfoliation. In terms of usage, Idriss recommends incorporating them at night after cleansing and before serums and moisturizers, since they can make you sensitive to the sun—so be sure to follow with sunscreen in the day. New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Morgan Rabach also notes that AHAs can help “even out pigmentation,” too.
Aloe Vera
Open up an aloe vera plant and you’ll discover an ingredient with calming and soothing skin properties, so you might notice it featured in products targeting stressed skin. Hartman notes it’s good to help sunburn, too.
Antioxidants
What are the antioxidants that Hartman considers necessary for any skin-care routine? According to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Elyse Love, the term “describes a group of ingredients that neutralize free radical damage caused by sun exposure, pollution, smoking, and other daily life encounters. Vitamin C and vitamin E are the most popular antioxidants, but there are many, many more.” Think ferulic acid, vitamin A, resveratrol, and technically niacinamide. Basically, these help keep your skin cells healthy.
Argan Oil
Facial oils are known to provide not only a surge of hydration but also an occlusive barrier that locks in moisture. With argan oil, Hartman notes that the ingredient is non-comedogenic, meaning it won’t clog pores.
Azelaic Acid
“Azelaic Acid is a compound that does a little bit of everything,” says Love. “It helps to improve redness, sensitivity, breakouts, and pigmentation. It’s great for rosacea and acne-prone skin.” And unlike the name suggests, Idriss notes this is not an exfoliating acid—unlike AHAs and BHAs—and can be used both morning and night.
Bakuchiol
Bakuchiol is a plant-derived retinol alternative that is “[good] for people unable to tolerate retinol if very sensitive skin or are just opposed to stronger formulas,” explains Hartman. Like its counterpart, this works to reduce fine lines, improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of pores. 
Benzoyl Peroxide
“Benzoyl peroxide is one of the most effective ingredients to treat red, inflammatory breakouts. It also helps to decrease oiliness of the skin,” says Love. “It can be irritating, so it’s best to stick to formulas that are around 2.5% for the face. Studies show these work as well as higher percentages but with less irritation. This is also a great ingredient to use in body wash form.” You’re likely to see it across acne-fighting skin treatments.
BHAs
Beta-hydroxy-acids, or BHAs, are the twins of AHAs—but when you think of this, think of salicylic acid. “BHAs are hot right now for their ability to superficially exfoliate. This leads to improvement in whiteheads, blackheads, dark spots, and overall skin texture,” says Love. BHAs can be irritating to those with sensitive skin. Idriss notes how these are optimal for those with oil or oil-producing skin. Keep in mind, though, that this is not safe for pregnancy.
Caffeine
Caffeine is not only good for energy in your morning coffee or tea but for the eye area. According to Rabach, it’s notable in “under-eye creams to reduce dark circles and puffiness around the eye.” Furthermore, cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Michele Green says it can be found in other face and body products too. “In body creams and scrubs, caffeine can improve cellulite. The caffeine dilates the blood vessels below the epidermis, which improves blood flow and reduces the appearance of cellulite. In facial creams, caffeine is known to reduce redness, inflammation, and over time diminish the appearance of sunspots, fine lines, and wrinkles.”
Ceramides
“Ceramides are an important natural component to the skin barrier,” says Love. “Day to day life—such as high winds, soaps, and hot water—remove ceramides from the skin and weaken the skin barrier. Skincare that includes ceramides helps to replenish the skin barrier.” Hartman explains that ceramides are “the most important moisturizing agent you could have in a moisturizer” component, dubbing it the “mortar that holds skin cells together.”
Glycerin
“Glycerin is a humectant, which means it draws water into the skin,” says Love. She continues that “it’s used in hydrating serums and moisturizers.” In fact, glycerin is a personal favorite of Idriss—she calls it her preferred humectant. She says it’s such an underrated ingredient and all skin types can benefit from it.
Glycolic Acid
“Glycolic acid is the strongest of the AHAs as it has the smallest molecular size, which means it penetrates deeper. Glycolic acid is great if you have acne-prone skin due to its ability to reduce excess sebum production and unclog the pores,” explains Green. “Another benefit of using glycolic acid is its ability to help fade and reduce hyperpigmentation caused by acne. It is best to use products containing glycolic acid at bedtime.” This is safe in pregnancy, so it makes for a thoughtful substitute to retinol while carrying.
Grapeseed Oil
According to Green, “grapeseed oil is packed with antioxidants such as vitamin E, A, and C.” She says that “using grapeseed oil can improve the texture, tone, and elasticity of the skin. All skin types can benefit from face oils. It can also clear up acne breakouts, bring the moisture to dull, dehydrated skin, even skin tone, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.” 
Green Tea
Green tea “is a potent anti-aging ingredient that is capable of fighting signs of aging,” says Green—beneficial for treating acne and unclogging pores “because it provides a powerful antibacterial agent for the skin. Using topical green tea extracts can also help neutralize free radicals as well as provide hydration for your skin and simply improve how your skin retains its moisture.”
Growth Factors
According to Hartman, growth factors “do an effective job regenerating skin cells faster,” though they can be controversial as they can lead to an over-production of bad versus good cells. When it comes to products, though, he notes that “SkinMedica was founded on growth factors. [The ingredient] TNS is the gold standard marquee product.”
Hyaluronic Acid
Those looking for a boost of hydration should have hyaluronic acid on hand, as Rabach says it’s a “humectant that works to pull water into the skin to plump skin and hydrate it.” Per Green: “Using Hyaluronic Acid regularly will help keep your skin hydrated and it may even help you look younger by 
Jojoba Oil
Jojoba oil is another non-comedogenic oil that won’t clog pores when used on the face or body. “Jojoba oil is very lightweight and dissolves quickly, which makes it the perfect carrier oil for most cosmetic products,” says Green. “It is great for use on sensitive skin and has similarities to human sebum. It contains seven acids such as palmitoleic acid known for its anti-aging properties in reducing the appearance of premature aging.”
Kojic Acid
“I love kojic acid,” says Idriss. “Kojic acid is not an exfoliating acid despite the name. It is a natural by-product of a fungus that has the ability to block the pathway of melanin, so it’s really useful to treat hyperpigmentation issues or melasma.”
Lactic Acid
Lactic acid is another of AHAs, and according to Love, “it gently exfoliates the top layer of skin and draws water into the skin.” Furthermore, Green explains that it is a melanin suppressor as it inhibits the enzyme responsible for melanin production. “Because it decreases your melanin production, you should wear sunscreen and protective clothing to protect the treated areas from sun damage. Lactic acid is hydrating, making it a great choice for sensitive or dry skin. It is best to use products containing it at bedtime.”
Occlusives
“Occlusives prevent transepidermal water loss, allowing the skin to hold on to its moisture,” says Love. Reach for these when you’re looking to slug the skin and trap hydration.
According to Green, peptides “are proteins that stimulate the growth of new cells and facilitate cell turnover while you sleep. Peptides also stimulate the production of collagen, which is a protein that is responsible for the skin’s firmness and suppleness.”
Petroleum Jelly
Idriss calls petroleum jelly “one of the best occlusives to restore a broken skin barrier.” She loves to use it every single day, especially under the eyes as a buffer if she’s applying retinol and she thinks her skin is too sensitive—furthering that it’s non-comedogenic. “Cosmetic grade petroleum jelly is extremely refined and not something to be feared.”
Retinol
“Retinol is a form of vitamin A that naturally occurs in the skin. It is commonly used in over-the-counter skin-care products, normally in concentrations of around 0.05 to 2 percent,” says Green, who explains that when topically applied, it “is clinically proven to improve lines, discoloration issues, and revitalize the skin.” Even more so, our experts share that it’s the most studied ingredient for anti-aging.
Rabach notes that it’s her number one recommended ingredient, dubbing it as a “powerhouse,” as it “evens out skin texture and tone, reduces pore size, increase collagen synthesis leading to decreased fine lines and wrinkles; reduces clogged pores and acne, helps scars, reduces skin cancers when used as a chemical peel.”
Idriss is a fan too—recommending you start slow when using to ensure your skin isn’t too sensitive for the formula. Oh, and it is best to use it at bedtime.
Rosehip Oil
“Rosehip oil is packed with antioxidants such as vitamin E, A and C, omega and linolenic acid—all essential components of the skin’s barrier function and the building block for collagen rebuilding,” explains Green of this nourishing ingredient. Per Hartman, the oil is also good for wound healing and cellular repair, too.
Salicylic Acid
According to Hartman, salicylic acid is the only BHA notably great for acne-prone skin. “It helps dry out acne, remove dead skin and oil, and even [helps] pigmentation,” explains Rabach. If you plan on using a cleanser with salicylic acid, though, Idriss emphasizes the need to let the cleanser sit on your face for a minute or so—to ensure it has time to treat the skin effectively.
Squalane
“Squalane is easily absorbed into the skin, leaving no residue behind,” says Green. “Squalane improves the skin’s elasticity and moisture retention as well as protects the skin against sun damage. In addition, squalane can prevent age spots, hyperpigmentation, and can also improve skin texture and tone.” She continues that “squalane is a very common moisturizer in skincare because it is an antioxidant, non-irritating, non-allergenic, and non-comedogenic. Squalane is also suitable for all skin types including dry, sensitive, oily as well as acne-prone skin.”
Titanium Oxide
Did you know there are different ingredients powering your sunscreens? Hartman prefers titanium oxide because it won’t cause the dreaded white cast. You might notice that many sunscreens are formulated with both titanium and zinc oxide, though. According to Rabach, this “with zinc helps block sunlight from entering skin cells to protect from skin cancer and pigmentation.”
Vitamin B3/Niacinamide
“Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, can be used to fade age spots as well as lighten discoloration of the skin,” says Green. “Niacinamide is effective with hyperpigmentation because it decreases the number of melanin transferred to pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) to cells in the epidermis (keratinocyte) by more than half. It does not stop the production of melanin, but it reduces the amount that is transferred to skin. It is also extremely stable and is not affected by heat or light.” If you want to start using niacinamide, Idriss recommends incorporating it in the morning and night after washing your face and before moisturizer—opting for products formulated between 3-5%.
Though niacinamide has received lots of buzz across recent years, Hartman doesn’t believe it’s a necessity—especially if you’re hoping to streamline your beauty regimen.
Vitamin C
You likely hear your favorite beauty enthusiasts wax on about their love for vitamin C, but clearly, it’s worth adding to your routine. Hartman calls it a “gold standard antioxidant.” In short, it “decreases oxidative stress and normalizes pigment production leading to a more even skin tone,” according to Love. She continues that “there are many active forms of vitamin C. The most potent form is l-ascorbic acid which is difficult to stabilize and can be irritating to sensitive skin.” Be sure to consult with an expert and spot test to ensure your selected vitamin C product won’t irritate your skin.
Vitamin E
“Vitamin E is an oil-based antioxidant that also supports the skin barrier and promotes skin hydration,” explains Love. Furthermore, Green says, “It is also known to promote skin healing, cellular turnover, and increase collagen production, giving you radiant and smoother looking skin. In addition, vitamin E is known for its ability to improve skin texture, [and] protect the skin against environmental stressors.”
Zinc Oxide
Rabach calls zinc oxide a “powerhouse ingredient [present] in physical sunblocks.” According to Love, the ingredient is the “most broad ultraviolet light blocker,” though the formula tends to be thick and “not cosmetically pleasing, but there are new formulations that challenge this stereotype.” For this reason, some experts believe this to be superior to titanium oxide and studied to be more effective overall.

Byrdie,"Alcohol: A group of organic compounds that come in a variety of forms, some of which are good and some of which are bad. Good alcohols have a high molecular weight, while low–molecular weight alcohols are bad. The bad forms to look for are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol, all of which may be drying, sensitizing, or damaging to the skin's moisture barrier. 
Aloe Vera: A popular plant extract that soothes and hydrates the skin while providing antioxidant benefits. While aloe is not as miraculous as the skincare industry sometimes likes to make it seem, it does have refreshing effects for irritated or sunburnt skin.
Alpha-Hydroxy Acid (AHA): Exfoliating ingredients that are either manufactured synthetically or are derived from milk and fruit sugars. AHAs break down the glue that holds dead skin cells together for a brightening effect. The most common and effective AHAs are lactic acid and glycolic acid.
Antioxidants: A group of natural and synthetic ingredients that protect skin against environmental stressors like free radicals. Popular antioxidants include vitamins E and C, lycopene, green tea, and niacinamide.
Argan Oil: A moisturizing, fragrance-free plant oil made from the kernels of argan trees. The oil contains skin-benefiting lipids, fatty acids, and antioxidants. This is another oil that's highly hyped up in the cosmetics world, but its use is merely for dry skin and hair and is no more beneficial than other plant oils, like coconut, jojoba, avocado, or grapeseed oil. Used in excess, the product can get greasy.
Benzoyl Peroxide: A well-researched over-the-counter antibacterial agent considered highly effective for treating acne by killing bacteria. 
Beta-Hydroxy Acid (BHA): Oil-soluble exfoliants that penetrate pores deeply to clear acne and blackheads. Salicylic acid is the most common BHA in skincare. 
Botanicals: A very general word referring to any ""natural"" or plant-derived ingredient, which may or may not be organic or even beneficial to the skin.
Caffeine: An antioxidant-containing stimulant often included in skincare products with the promise of reducing cellulite and/or puffy eyes. There is mixed research proving its effectiveness for these conditions and it can have irritating effects on some skin types, but when applied topically it may feel soothing and improve redness.
Collagen: A type of fibrous protein derived from animals that acts as a water-binding agent to keep moisture locked into the skin. Topical collagen has not been found to encourage the body to produce more of its own collagen; however, ingestible collagen may increase skin elasticity. 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): A fat-soluble ingredient that our bodies naturally produce. The substance has soothing antioxidant effects on the skin when applied topically.
Clay: A popular cosmetic ingredient that comes from a variety of natural sources and works well to absorb excess oil in the skin and unclog congested pores. One of the most popular types is bentonite clay, which comes from volcanic ash sediments.
Dihydroxyacetone (DHA): An ingredient found in most self-tanners derived from sugar. It affects the color of the skin's top layers by reacting with the skin's amino acids to turn the skin a darker shade of brown over the course of several hours.
Elastin: A naturally occurring component that gives skin its flexibility. When applied topically, it helps skin retain moisture but has not been shown to affect the skin's natural elastic production.
Emollient: A hydrating, thickening agent that helps skin hold onto moisture for a softening, soothing effect. Natural emollients include plant oils, mineral oil, shea, and cocoa butters, and fatty acids. Petrolatum, lecithin, triglycerides, benzoates, myristates, and palmitates are also emollients that give many skincare products their creamy texture.
Essential Oils: Fragrant plant extracts with anti-aging and aromatherapeutic properties that can be highly irritating when applied directly to the skin. Essential oils should be combined with a fatty carrier oil, like jojoba, before used topically. Frankincense, a skin-benefiting essential oil, has anti-inflammatory properties.
Glycerin: A humectant naturally found in the skin that helps it maintain a soft, moisturized, healthy look. Used topically in combination with other emollients and antioxidants, it has been shown to be very effective at restoring the skin. 
Green Tea: An antioxidant-containing ingredient shown to have anti-aging effects on the skin, including an ability to soothe and improve the appearance of sun damage.
Humectant: A substance used in skincare products to help skin hold onto moisture. Humectants can be natural or synthetic and include aloe, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, propylene glycol, and silicone.
Hyaluronic Acid (HA): A naturally found component of skin tissue re-created synthetically to help restore, hydrate, and protect skin from environmental stressors. The ingredient agrees with almost all skin types.
Jojoba Oil: A lightweight, fragrance-free plant oil that is incredibly effective at treating dry skin without the greasy effect of other plant oils, like argan and coconut.
Mineral Oil: A colorless, odorless distillation byproduct of petroleum often found in moisturizer for its ability to soothe skin and help it hang onto moisture. Mineral oil can be pore-clogging for some, but it isn't shown to be as harmful as it's cracked up to be.
Parabens: Preservatives including ibutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben, which some believe contain a dangerous amount of estrogen, putting women's health at risk. These preservatives are largely safe when not used in excess, though most brands still make their products paraben-free to comply with consumer beliefs.17
Phthalate: A salt of phthalic acid that has been used in many hair sprays and nail polishes for decades but that many consumers avoid for the fear that they are damaging to human health. Though the evidence for this is limited, most brands have made their formulas phthalate-free.18
Silicone: A substance derived from silica that gives products a silky, slippery texture and can smooth the look of pores. The ingredient is not dangerous or suffocating to the skin, though some do not prefer the texture. Common silicones in skincare include cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane, dimethicone, and phenyl trimethicone.
Sodium Hyaluronate: The salt form of hyaluronic acid. This is considered even more effective as a moisturizing ingredient, as it can absorb better into the skin.
Sulfate: A group of cleansing agents found in many face washes including sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate, which can cause sensitivity and dryness when used in excess or when left on the skin for too long, but are generally not shown to be as damaging as the cosmetic industry makes it seem.
Vitamin E: A well-researched antioxidant that protects skin effectively against antioxidant damage and has been shown to be marginally more effective in its natural form than its synthetic form.
Titanium Oxide: An earth mineral used in natural sunscreen, as it protects the skin from UVA and UVB radiation with no risk of sensitivity. The ingredient is recommended for irritative, redness-prone skin.
Zinc Oxide: Another non-irritating natural sunscreen ingredient often used alongside titanium dioxide.",https://www.byrdie.com/skincare-ingredients-glossary
